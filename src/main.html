<p class="fst-italic"> Beer is universal, or is it? Beer is consumed all around the world and after water and tea the third most popular beverage. In popular culture, beer is typically not associated with one particular season, unlike hot chocolate or iced tea. But how year-round of a beverage is beer really? Can we observe seasonal patterns in consumption and preferences? This project explores seasonal fluctuations in beer preferences, by analyzing beer reviews posted on the BeerAdvocate forum, spanning from 2002 to 2017.</p>
</p>We begin by identifying seasonal patterns, checking their consistency across years, and quantifying them. Next, we analyze if specific beer types drive these patterns, whether through differences in ratings, review counts, or both. Finally, we explore external factors like climate or weather that may explain the observed trends.</p>

        <section id="seasonality">
          <h2>Let's talk seasonality</h2>
          <h3 class="h4">Why we started this project</h3>
          <p>Figure <a href="#fig-avg-ratings" class="fig-ref">X</a> displays the average ratings for all beers across every month from multiple years, based on over two million ratings. 
             appears to show fluctuations in beer ratings throughout the year.</p>
          <figure id="fig-avg-ratings">
            <iframe data-src="src/plotly-html-graphs/jakob/MainSeasonalNarrow.html" title="Line plot of averaged ratings per month." frameborder="0" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="300px"></iframe>
            <figcaption><span>Figure 1</span><strong>Average ratings per month.</strong> 95% confidence interval with 2'239'823 data points.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>But why could this be the case? Why would beer ratings fluctuate like this?</p>
          <p>
            In this project, our goal is to investigate the underlying reasons for this apparent seasonal behavior in beer ratings.
            Specifically, we seek to answer three key questions:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Seasonality</strong>: Is this pattern driven by consistent year-to-year effects, or are the fluctuations merely the result of outliers or a few exceptionally strong years distorting the average?</li>
              <li><strong>Beer Types</strong>: Are specific types of beers driving these seasonal variations, perhaps through seasonal spikes in average ratings or number of ratings?</li>
              <li><strong>Meteo</strong>: Could factors like climate or weather influence these rating trends?</li>
            </ul>
            Through careful analysis, we aim to uncover the reasons behind the observed seasonal behavior in beer ratings in Figure <a href="#fig-avg-ratings" class="fig-ref">X</a> and provide a deeper understanding of the trends reflected in the Main Average Rating Plot.

          <section id="fourier">
            <h3 class="h4">Verifying Year-to-Year Seasonality: Are the Patterns Consistent?</h3>
            <p>To determine whether the observed seasonality across years is due to a consistent annual pattern rather than outliers or singular dominant years skewing the mean.</p>
            <p>First, we preprocess the data using STL decomposition. STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) separates the seasonal component from the underlying trend and residual (noise) in the monthly rating averages. We use STL decomposition to extract the seasonal component by removing the trend and noise, 
              thus making the signal clearer for further analysis. STL is particularly effective because it is resilient to outliers, handles missing data, and reduces noise <a href="https://doi.org/10.17535/crorr.2021.0006" target="_blank">(Arneric, 2021)</a>.</p>
            <p>After extracting the seasonal component with STL, we apply the Fourier transform to identify dominant frequencies. If the dominant period is 12 months, this confirms that the average rating pattern is yearly seasonal.</p>
            <figure id="fig-fourier">
              <iframe data-src="src/plotly-html-graphs/jakob/seasonality_full.html" title="Fourier transform of the seasonal component of the average ratings." frameborder="0" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="820"></iframe>
              <figcaption><span>Figure 2</span><strong>Seasonality Report - Average Ratings of All Beers.</strong> The dominant period is 12 months.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure <a href="#fig-fourier" class="fig-ref">X</a> presents the seasonality analysis pipeline. The first plot shows the original average ratings time series for all beers, aggregated monthly from 2002 to 2017, where the seasonality is obscured by the overall trend.
              The second plot displays the seasonal signal extracted using STL decomposition, making the 12-month seasonality visually apparent. The third plot shows the frequency domain analysis, with a distinct peak at 0.083 cycles per month, corresponding to a 12-month period.
              The following section provides the numerical evaluation to verify the significance of this 12-month signal.</p>
            <p>We calculate the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to determine the strength of the observed yearly pattern relative to random noise, providing a quantitative measure of signal reliability. SNR is particularly useful because it has well-defined thresholds that help distinguish meaningful patterns from noise. According to a <a href="https://support.numxl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050017731-Calculating-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio-Using-DFT" target="_blank">NumXL article</a>
              on data analysis, an SNR between 10 and 15 dB typically indicates a strong, reliable signal.</p>
            <p>While any SNR > 0 dB shows that the signal is stronger than the noise floor, we adopt a cutoff of 10 dB to confirm seasonality, following NumXL's (2020) guidelines for calculating SNR using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The calculated SNR of 21.3 dB for the signal indicates that the 12-month peak is highly significant, strongly suggesting that the average ratings are influenced by consistent year-to-year effects.</p>

          <section id="scores">
            <h3 class="h4">Definition of metrics to quantify seasonality</h3>
            <p>
              To better understand the observed trends and identify whether a specific subset of beers is driving the seasonality, we introduce two metrics: <i>mean amplitude</i> and <i>peak ratio</i>, which are visualized in Figure <a href="#fig-metrics" class="fig-ref">X</a>. These metrics are designed to quantify and compare the strength and significance of seasonality across different beer subsets.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean amplitude:</strong>  This metric measures the overall strength of the seasonal signal across the entire period. By calculating the amplitude of the seasonal component for each period and taking the average, we can compare the intensity of seasonality between subsets. This helps highlight how strongly a subset's ratings fluctuate seasonally.</li>
                <li><strong>Peak Ratio:</strong> This metric ensures the signal is primarily driven by a 12-month periodicity rather than random noise or other dominant frequencies. By calculating the ratio of the 12-month peak to the second-largest peak, we can assess the significance of the 12-month period. A large ratio indicates that the 12-month signal stands out as the dominant periodicity, confirming meaningful seasonality.</li>
              </ul>

          <h2>Weather Influence on Beer Ratings</h2>
          <p>After examining the seasonality of beer ratings, we noticed that both the number of ratings and the average rating vary seasonally across different beer styles. This observation led us to ask: why does this happen? Since the composition of the beer itself remains constant throughout the year, these seasonal patterns must be influenced by external factors. We then considered: what external factors change seasonally? One obvious candidate is weather, which varies by season and is influenced by the climate zone. This prompted us to investigate whether there is a correlation between average beer ratings and weather or climate zone data.</p>
          <p>
            To explore this, we collected weather and climate data from various sources. However, since each beer rating is associated with only a single state, we needed to meaningfully summarize weather and climate information for each state:
            <ul>
              <li><i>Climate: </i>For each state, we identified a single representative climate zone based on the climate zones where most of the state‚Äôs population resides. Climate zone data was from the International Energy Conservation Code, population data from the United States Census Bureau.</li>
              <li><i>Weather: </i>We experimented with both monthly and daily weather data. As monthly data we considered precomputed average temperature and precipitation data for each state between 2002 and 2017 using World Bank Climate Data. As daily weather we used the meadian median daily maximum temperature per state from 2012 to 2017 as a metric. Daily data was sourced from the Global Historical Climatology Network dataset provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 class="h4">Interpretation</h3>
          <p>Several key conclusions emerge from our analysis:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Weather effects on beer ratings are detectable and statistically significant when analyzed at appropriate temporal scales</li>
            <li>While significant, weather conditions explain only a tiny fraction of rating variance (all weather factors combined explain less than 1%)</li>
            <li>Subjective measures are overwhelmingly more important, with taste alone explaining 94.3% of rating variance</li>
          </ol>
        
          <h3 class="h4">Limitations</h3>
          <p>Our analysis has several important limitations to consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>State-level weather aggregates might mask local variations</li>
            <li>The location of the reviewer at the time of rating might differ from their registered state</li>
            <li>Different beer styles might respond differently to weather conditions</li>
            <li>The relationship between weather and ratings might vary by season or region in ways our analysis couldn't capture</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>Overall, our analysis shows that while weather conditions have a statistically significant influence on beer ratings, this effect is extremely subtle compared to the dominant role of the beer's intrinsic qualities. The temporal granularity of analysis is crucial for detecting these subtle weather effects, suggesting that the relationship between weather and beer appreciation is more complex than previously understood.</p>

          <h2>The dataset</h2>
          <p>The data used for this project was extracted from the beer rating website BeerAdvocate, where users can publicly rate beers. We focused on data from BeerAdvocate only to ensure metrics stay as consistent as possible. The dataset contains information about users, ratings, and breweries from 1998 until 2018.</p>
          <p>
            All ratings contain certain "minimal data". For the scope of this project four rating attributes were of particular interest to us: 
            <ul>
              <li>Rating score: a computed score ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest quality.</li>
              <li>Timestamp: the exact date and time the rating was uploaded to BeerAdvocate.</li>
              <li>User location: the US state or country specified by the user when creating an account for BeerAdvocate.</li>
              <li>Beer style: a categorical attribute grouping beers into styles such as American IPA or Belgian Strong Dark Ale.</li>
            </ul>
            Ratings with supplementary information are called reviews; they additionally include textual descriptions of the beer and numeric scores for appearance, aroma, palate, taste and overall impression.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the analysis, we applied the following criteria to refine the dataset:
            <ul>
              <li>Time-range: only ratings from 2002 to 2017 were included. Before 2002 too little data was available. Data for 2018 covered the first few months only, making it unsuited for seasonal analysis.</li>
              <li>Rating method: reviews only. BeerAdvocate changed its rating system a few times. Reviews were the original rating method. In 2011 a different rating method without additional information such as textual descriptions was allowed. We chose to use reviews only. It is less data, but more importantly, it's more balanced over the years.</li>
              <li>Location: United States only. Firstly the vast majority of the user base is from the US. Secondly focusing on this region enables more meaningful climate and weather analysis. We assume that the user's location when rating a beer is the same as the location (state) specified when creating the BeerAdvocate account.</li>
